		<p>
			You need to acquire a legal copy of Spyro the Dragon (either PAL or NTSC-U), extract its .bin file and select it as the "Spyro 1 ROM file".
		</p><p>
			To play on PS2, choose one of the PS2 versions under "Platform and Region". For any other platform (PS1, PS3, Emulator etc.), choose one of the PS1 versions.
		</p><p>
			To play burned discs on original hardware, modding the console through tools such as <a href="https://github.com/MechaResearch/MechaPwn" style="color: #b688ba">MechaPwn</a> is required. Only use CDs; DVDs will not work!
		</p><p>
			Once you are loaded into the game, supercharge sharp turning (by holding down left or down right) might not work immediately. If this is the case, use R3 + Up/Down to calibrate the sharp turn offset. Usually, the offset should be somewhere between -4 and 4.

		<div>0.1b
Initial Beta Release
0.1.1b
Fixed an issue where the game crashes when trying to view the 120% Ending
0.2b
Added custom Time Attack screens after beating Gnasty Gnorc and after 120% completion
Added IGT to Inventory Screen
Improved flight speed when initiating flight without momentum (this includes flight levels, making them more speedway viable)
Added fixed heightcaps (set at same heights as SRT)
Added manual sharp turn calibration (change offset by pressing R3 + Up/Down)
Fixed an issue where the game could crash when supercharge jumping after rolling or roll bouncing.
Removed the ability to change supercharge speed in-game (you can still set the supercharge speed from within the Mod Options)
0.3b
Added Superfly Jumping (similar to Spyro 2/3)
Added Spyro 2/3 like wing flapping while flying to gain height
Flight is now enabled during fly out animations
Flight speed can no longer be influenced by momentum storage (flying above the heightcap is also impossible as a result)
To make Gnasty's Loot work properly with the above change, custom heightcap code was added where heightcaps are unlocked either by being grounded for the first heightcap raise or using keys for all other heightcap raises
Renamed Inventory to Guidebook
Added Individual Level IGT with menu screens upon completion, pausing + quitting and dying with 0 lives in a level
Level collectibles are now reset when replaying levels but aren't removed from the guidebook by storing the highest number of collectables gotten in a play through
Lives are now temporary and per level, starting with 0 lives. You cannot lose or gain lives in homeworlds or flight levels
Removed fly in animations to standardise Individual Level IGT
Simplified when IGT is counted
Movement is now locked while calibrating sharp turns to prevent Spyro from moving while modifying offset values
Added key glitch fix
Fixed an issue where triggering a fairy interaction caused black bars to appear and stay making it impossible to pause the game and potentially crashing the game</div>
